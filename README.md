ray-based-rendering
===================

Project Overview:
-----------------
This is a simple ray-tracing project. It focuses on clean and easy to program
code rather than speed. Currently, only ray-tracing is being developed, but I
expect to transition into a path-tracer later.

Compiling:
----------
Requires that you have gcc (for c++) and libpng on your system.
In the project directory run:
>make
>./render


The code is documented in a Doxygen format. Use doxygen to generate the
documentation. It can be used as a reference for the code.

Todo's are included in the code. Search for 'TODO' if you want to find some in the code.
